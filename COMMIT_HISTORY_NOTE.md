# Commit History Note

**Repository Status**: Some earlier commits contain Claude/Anthropic references in commit messages. These are artifacts from the development process and do not affect the functionality or licensing of the code.

**Current Policy**: All future commits will not contain any Claude/Anthropic references.

**Affected Commits**: 
- Commits from 2025-08-18 may contain "Generated with Claude Code" footers
- These references are only in commit messages, not in actual code files
- The code itself is independent of any AI assistance tools

**Code Independence**: All code in this repository is standard shell scripting, Python, and package management - no proprietary or AI-dependent components.

**Repository Focus**: This repository documents the **failed attempt** to make Splashtop work on Kali Linux 2025.2 due to binary compatibility issues.
